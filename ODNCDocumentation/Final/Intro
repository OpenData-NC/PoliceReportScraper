This documentation assumes the reader is familiar with Django and Apache.
The main components to focus on are:
  1. The pdf scraper
  2. models.py
  3. urls.py/ views.py
  4. The html pages and associated javascript/ css files

The ODNC Web App works by scraping information from police report pdfs. This information is then entered into the Django database in a format specified by models.py. Then this information
is connected to the front-facing webpage by views.py. Finally, the html pages and their javascript/css files specify how this information is viewed by the user, as well as pass user
database queries through views.py.
