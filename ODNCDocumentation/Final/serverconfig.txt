=====================
Django and Apache Configuration
=====================

All of our django specific files are under the main project folder 'odnc_police/odnc_police/'
this includes models.py, views.py, urls.py. Static files had to be handled by Apache specifically,
so all of the javascript, images, etc are under /var/www and aliased by the Apache config.
We also had to configure apache to point to our wsgi. using

WSGIScriptAlias / /home/vaughn.hagerty/django/PoliceReportScraper/odnc_police/odnc_police/wsgi.py
WSGIPythonPath /home/vaughn.hagerty/django/PoliceReportScraper/odnc_police

in the apache config file.
