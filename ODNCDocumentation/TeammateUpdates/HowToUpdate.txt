If you want to update Sphinx, put a text file in this folder. If you want to figure out how to structure those files to 
make them look good (it doesn't take long), you can. But you only have to give me a .txt file and I can update the Sphinx
documentation. Just put it in this folder with any notes on where you want to link to other pages or where you want to put
snippets of code, etc.
