=====================
PDF Uploader
=====================

uploader.sh takes 1 or more arguments.  If the first argument is a directory, it looks through it and
finds all of the pdfs, otherwise it loops through all of the given arguments and picks out the pdfs from there.
It then converts the pdfs to xml, and passes those to the scraper to get the fields as python objects.  
Those objects are then used to construct a new record instance, which is then saved to the database.
