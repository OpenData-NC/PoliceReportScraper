I'll be using Sphinx to handle the documentation for this project. 
http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html
It can export as html and text file, so any changes I make will be reflected in text, which can be tracked in
version control on Github, and a stylized version will be available online online at a URL to be determined. 
The online html version will be the "official" documentation (unless preferences change).

If you want to make changes to the documentation, simply edit whatever text file will be produced in the future (it will
be on Github and it will be version controlled) and I will see that a change has been made in version control and edit
the master version accordingly.

I may also use Dr. Explain for screenshots of the user interface that need to be explained. That way we can get
good looking images like the one on this page http://www.drexplain.com/software-documentation-tool/application-windows-capturing-annotation.php
